# KeyLogger

This is a very basic keylogger. It works by saving all the keystrokes in a file called "data.txt" until the "esc" key is pressed. 
Future plans include how to make it continously record keystrokes and to send the "data.txt" file twice a day to a computer that you specify the ip address of in an environment variable.
